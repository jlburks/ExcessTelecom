          Internet Service and Low-Cost Devices through the Affordable
          Connectivity Program (ACP), Lifeline and New Connection Plans
        </h6>
        <p>
          New enrollments into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) stopped
          on February 7, 2024 and the ACP will run through April unless the
          Federal government approves more funding. Customers enrolled in the
          ACP as of February 8, 2024 will continue to receive ACP coverage
          unless the ACP ends or they lose program eligibility. At Excess
          Telecom, we're dedicated to ensuring that you and your family continue
          to enjoy reliable internet access through the ACP and beyond. Click
          here for the latest information on the ACP Wind-Down.
